* How to start
when building the project create a build directory and a valid compile_commands.json file
#+BEGIN_SRC
# create the build directory
mkdir build

# initialize the project by getting the dependencies and structure provided by CMakePresets.json
cmake --preset=default
# build the project
cmake --build build
#+END_SRC

Then create a symlink from the build folder to the root.
This is so that the Language server protocol (LSP) knows about your fetched libs
#+BEGIN_SRC
ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
#+END_SRC
